# Flight Axis
The Flight axis python script assists with the HITL simulation using Real flight sim. This script will allow you to communicate with the PX4 system updating the different recorded characteristics of the aircraft. It can also change how you control the simulations input, such as joy stick or RC controller.

# 13_05_2021__16_16_38
This matlab file contains flight data from may 13th 2021 flight simulation used for the system identification of aerodynamic coefficients

# Sys ID 
The Sys ID script file will take in the system identification variables given in the 13_05_2021 script and plot a simulation model displaying airspeed and degrees

# Requirements text
The required packages to run the scripts are as follows; requests, navpy, bs4, pymavlink, magnetic_field_calculator, numpy, quaternionic.
